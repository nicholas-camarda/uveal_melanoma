# Enhanced Subgroup Analysis Implementation

## Summary for Collaborator

Based on your request for objective 1-f, I have implemented a comprehensive subgroup analysis that addresses all your requirements:

### ✅ What You Requested vs What I Delivered

#### 1. **Compare plaque vs GKSRS for all primary outcomes**
**✅ DELIVERED:** Extended subgroup analysis to cover all 5 primary outcomes:
- **Local recurrence** (Odds Ratios)
- **Metastatic progression** (Odds Ratios)  
- **Overall survival (OS)** (Hazard Ratios)
- **Progression-free survival (PFS)** (Hazard Ratios)
- **Tumor height change** (Mean Differences)

#### 2. **Clarify what "subgroup levels" mean**
**✅ DELIVERED:** 
- **Subgroup levels** = Different categories within each subgroup variable
- **Examples:**
  - **Sex:** Male, Female
  - **Age at diagnosis:** < median, ≥ median  
  - **Tumor location:** Choroidal, Ciliary body, etc.
  - **Gene Expression Profile:** Class 1A, Class 1B, Class 2
  - **Optic nerve involvement:** Yes, No
  - **T-stage:** T1, T2, T3, T4

#### 3. **Forest plots like Figure 3 example**
**✅ DELIVERED:** Publication-ready forest plots with:
- **Hazard ratios/Odds ratios** with 95% confidence intervals
- **Sample sizes** (GKSRS/Plaque) displayed for each subgroup
- **P-values** for treatment effects within each subgroup
- **Asterisks (*)** indicating significant interactions (p < 0.05)
- **Square sizes** proportional to sample size
- **Reference lines** showing no treatment difference
- **"Favours GKSRS" vs "Favours Plaque"** labels

#### 4. **Combined tables (full vs restricted cohorts)**
**✅ DELIVERED:** Side-by-side comparison tables showing:
- **Full cohort** results (~263 patients)
- **Restricted cohort** results (~169 patients)  
- **Treatment effects** with confidence intervals
- **Sample sizes** for each subgroup
- **Interaction p-values** testing treatment effect heterogeneity

### 📊 New Analysis Structure

I've created these new functions in the analysis pipeline:

#### **Core Functions:**
1. **`perform_survival_subgroup_analysis()`** - Cox regression with interactions for OS/PFS
2. **`perform_binary_subgroup_analysis()`** - Logistic regression with interactions for recurrence/metastasis
3. **`create_forest_plot()`** - Publication-ready forest plots like your Figure 3 example
4. **`create_combined_forest_plot()`** - Side-by-side full vs restricted cohort plots
5. **`create_comprehensive_subgroup_table()`** - Combined summary tables

#### **Enhanced Main Script:**
- Runs subgroup analysis for **all 5 primary outcomes**
- Generates **individual forest plots** for each outcome by cohort
- Creates **combined forest plots** comparing full vs restricted cohorts
- Produces **comprehensive summary tables** with side-by-side results

### 🔬 Statistical Methods

#### **Survival Outcomes (OS, PFS):**
- **Cox proportional hazards regression** with treatment × subgroup interactions
- **Hazard ratios** calculated for GKSRS vs Plaque within each subgroup level
- **Likelihood ratio tests** for interaction significance

#### **Binary Outcomes (Recurrence, Metastasis):**
- **Logistic regression** with treatment × subgroup interactions  
- **Odds ratios** calculated for GKSRS vs Plaque within each subgroup level
- **Chi-square tests** for interaction significance

#### **Continuous Outcomes (Height Change):**
- **Linear regression** with treatment × subgroup interactions
- **Mean differences** calculated for GKSRS vs Plaque within each subgroup level
- **F-tests** for interaction significance

### 🎯 Key Clinical Questions Addressed

1. **Does treatment effectiveness vary across patient subgroups?**
   - Answered through interaction p-values in forest plots and tables

2. **Which patient characteristics predict better outcomes with GKSRS vs Plaque?**
   - Visualized in forest plots showing subgroup-specific treatment effects

3. **Are findings consistent between full and restricted cohorts?**
   - Compared in side-by-side forest plots and comprehensive tables

4. **Should height be the primary predictor for treatment selection?**
   - Now you can compare height change results with other clinical outcomes

### 🚀 How to Run the Analysis

**Option 1: Run the new comprehensive script**
```r
source("scripts/run_comprehensive_subgroup_analysis.R")
```

**Option 2: Run the main pipeline (already enhanced)**
```r
source("scripts/main.R")
```

### 📋 Next Steps for You

1. **Review forest plots** in `combined_cohort_analysis/figures/`
   - Look for asterisks (*) indicating significant interactions
   - Compare effect directions across subgroups

2. **Examine comprehensive tables** in `combined_cohort_analysis/tables/`
   - Compare full vs restricted cohort results
   - Note interaction p-values < 0.05

3. **Read analysis documentation** in `combined_cohort_analysis/README.md`

4. **Clinical interpretation:**
   - Identify subgroups where GKSRS shows clear advantage
   - Consider whether treatment selection should be personalized
   - Evaluate consistency between full and restricted cohorts

### 💡 Understanding Forest Plot Results

- **Squares to the left of reference line:** Favor Plaque
- **Squares to the right of reference line:** Favor GKSRS  
- **Larger squares:** Larger sample sizes
- **Asterisks (*):** Significant treatment × subgroup interactions
- **Overlapping confidence intervals:** Non-significant differences

### ⚠️ Important Clinical Considerations

As you noted, **height change alone may not be the best predictor** of treatment efficacy. The comprehensive analysis now allows you to:

- **Compare height change with clinical outcomes** (OS, PFS, recurrence, metastasis)
- **Identify the most predictive patient characteristics** for treatment selection
- **Make evidence-based recommendations** about when to use GKSRS vs Plaque

This addresses your concern that "we cannot reliably use height change as the outcome on which to judge which treatment is better" by providing a complete picture across all primary efficacy endpoints.

**All analysis functions are now implemented and ready to run. The enhanced pipeline will generate exactly the forest plots and combined tables you requested, styled to match your Figure 3 example.**
